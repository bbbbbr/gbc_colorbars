# Game Boy Color Test Images

The first 2 horizontal color bar patterns (RGB, CMYK) have exactly 32 colors in their gradients. If any of the colors are missing or mis-aligned to the grey reference blocks it means the color depth on the screen or emulation may not be accurate or is getting clipped in some way.

Note: Some emulators may shift GBC color values up or down a value before displaying, or slightly clip the range for the 32 color bar images. This does not happen on OEM hardware.
